## 3. Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lib/store/scheduleStore.ts` | All schedule state + mutations; undo history; recalc trigger |
| `lib/hooks/useSaveActions.ts` | save / saveAs / saveForce / conflict resolution / cloud load |
| `lib/recalcRows.ts` | Time cascade — recomputes all row times from call time + durations |
| `lib/rowNormalizer.ts` | Upgrades loaded JSON to current row schema |
| `lib/constants.ts` | ACTIONS list, color maps, UNDO_LIMIT=80, AUTO_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_MS=5min |
| `netlify/functions/save.js` | Conflict detection (expectedSavedAt + expectedHash), stableStringify |
| `netlify/functions/load.js` | Auth-gated load; `public=1` param for unauthenticated client view |
| `components/schedule/ScheduleEditor.tsx` | Main editor mount; auto-snapshot watcher; storeReady guard |
| `components/schedule/CrewIdentityBlock.tsx` | Inline-edit crew display between identity line and meta-grid |
| `components/toolbar/SaveDropdown.tsx` | Split Save button; dropdown uses position:fixed to escape overflow |
| `components/toolbar/ShareDropdown.tsx` | Share/Print/Export dropdown; same fixed-position escape pattern |

| `components/schedule/ComboInput.tsx` | Typeahead input with filtered dropdown; used for projectName/phase in identity line |

## 4. State Management

Three Zustand stores:

**scheduleStore** — owns all schedule data:
- `rows`, `meta`, `scheduleName`, `dirty`, `syncStatus`, `conflictData`
- `remoteBaseline: { savedAt, hash }` — last known server state for conflict detection
- `undoStack` / `redoStack` (max 80 entries, serialized row snapshots)
- `loadSchedule()` calls `recalcRows()` + `repositionSunRows()` internally
- `getScheduleData()` returns current rows + meta for save/snapshot payloads
- `updateMeta(patch)` sets `dirty: true` — triggers autosave

**authStore** — `token: string | null` from sessionStorage

**cmsStore** — branding config; `applyConfig()` injects CSS custom properties + `<style>` block; CMS button lives in Library header (not editor toolbar)

## 5. Data Flow

```
User edits row
  → scheduleStore mutation → dirty = true
  → recalcRows() cascades times through all rows

Save button
  → useSaveActions.save()
  → reads remoteBaselineRef.current (mutable ref, always fresh)
  → POST /.netlify/functions/save with { expectedSavedAt, expectedHash }
  → 200: updateBaseline(savedAt, hash) + markClean()
  → 409: setConflictData({ local, remote }) → ConflictModal shown

Load schedule
  → loadScheduleFromCloud(name) in useSaveActions
  → POST /.netlify/functions/load
  → normalizeRows() → loadSchedule() → recalcRows()
  → updateBaseline(savedAt, '') — server hash unknown until first save
```

## 6. Auth Flow

1. User visits any `(app)` route — middleware checks `rp_auth_flag` cookie
2. No cookie → redirect to `/login?next=<original-path>`
3. Login page: PIN → HMAC token stored in sessionStorage + cookie set
4. Redirect to `?next=` target (or `/`)
5. All API calls send token in POST body as `editorToken`
6. Team Link (`/schedule/[name]?auth=true`) — `?auth=true` tells login page to show PIN inline; after unlock, redirects back to the schedule URL

Public client links (`/view/[name]`) bypass auth entirely — no token needed, load function accepts `public=1`.

## 7. Netlify Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `save.js` | Write schedule; conflict detection via savedAt + stableStringify hash |
| `load.js` | Read schedule; supports `public=1` for unauthenticated reads |
| `snapshots.js` | Read/write named snapshots per schedule (store: schedule-snapshots) |
| `library.js` | Read/write library metadata blob (phaseOrder, tsarchived, display name overrides, folder map, town/date caches) |
| `rename-schedule.js` | Rename a schedule; copies blob to new key, migrates snapshot, updates all Library metadata references, deletes old blobs best-effort; cross-checks Library metadata on rename-back to avoid false 409 from stale CDN reads |
| `move-schedule.js` | Move a schedule between productions/phases; coordinated two-write operation (not atomic): writes updated `meta.projectName`/`meta.phase` to schedule blob first, then updates `phaseOrder` in Library metadata; schedule name, snapshots, and links are preserved |
| `delete-schedule.js` | Permanent delete of archived schedules; validates editorToken + delete passcode; deletes schedule blob, snapshot blob (best-effort), and cleans all library metadata references atomically |
| `cms.js` | Read/write CMS branding config |
| `templates.js` | Read/write reusable schedule templates (store: schedule-templates) |
| `places.js` | Google Places API proxy (forwards Referer, adds API key) |

All functions share the same HMAC auth check (`SCHEDULE_APP_PASSWORD` + `SCHEDULE_AUTH_SECRET`). `delete-schedule.js` additionally requires `SCHEDULE_DELETE_PASSWORD`; it is the sole server-side entry point for permanent schedule deletion.

## 8. Public Routes

| Route | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/view/[name]` | None | Client/vendor read-only viewer |
| `/schedule/[name]` | PIN | Editor (also used for read-only with `?readonly=true`) |
| `/login` | None | PIN entry |

## 9. Architectural Quirks

**remoteBaselineRef pattern** — `useSaveActions` keeps a mutable ref updated synchronously after every save response, mirroring the Zustand `remoteBaseline` slice. Zustand batching can produce intermediate renders where `dirty=false` but the store baseline is stale; the ref bypasses React's re-render cycle entirely.

**Hash algorithm mismatch** — server uses `stableStringify` (sorted keys); client's old `hashSchedule` used `JSON.stringify` (insertion-order). Client-computed hashes are never used as baselines. Initial baseline uses `hash: ''`; after any save the server-returned hash is stored and reused verbatim.

**recalcRows after load** — `loadSchedule()` calls `recalcRows()` which rewrites row `timeOut` values. Rows in the store differ from the raw JSON on disk. `getScheduleData()` returns post-recalc rows; this is intentional (server always gets canonical data) but means you cannot diff store rows against raw loaded JSON.

**Sun rows** — `recalcRows` skips sun rows (`continue` without advancing the cursor). Sun rows are repositioned to stay at sunrise/sunset times relative to call time via `repositionSunRows`.

**storeReady guard** — `ScheduleEditor` checks `scheduleName === name` before rendering to prevent flashing stale data during route transitions.

**Auto-snapshot** — 5-minute `setInterval` in `ScheduleEditor`. Uses `dirtyRef`/`snapshotRef` mutable refs (updated every render) to avoid stale closure capturing `dirty=false` at mount time.

**Favicon** — served from `app/favicon.ico` as a Next.js metadata route. Public-directory assets (`public/*.ico`) were intercepted by Netlify's edge middleware despite matcher exclusions; the `app/` placement bypasses middleware entirely.

**Static asset middleware exclusion** — matcher uses `[^/]*\\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|svg|ico|webp|gif|woff2?|ttf|eot)` negative lookahead with non-capturing group (`(?:)` required — Next.js 15 rejects capturing groups in matchers).

**PWA** — `app/manifest.ts` auto-served at `/manifest.webmanifest`; iOS meta tags via `appleWebApp` in layout metadata; 192×192 and 512×512 icons generated from `apple-touch-icon.png` (1254×1254 source).

**Print** — `@page { size: landscape }` in `print.css`. `lib/print.ts` sets `document.title` to `"[scheduleName] – [YYYY-MM-DD today]"` before `window.print()`, restores via `setTimeout(100)`. Print CSS is structured in versioned blocks (V5–V14k) appended over time. Desktop/laptop baseline: `thead th { font-size: 9px }`, `td { font-size: 8.1px }`, `.hdr-title { font-size: 17px }`. Touch/mobile device print overrides are scoped with `@media print and (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` — this catches both phones AND tablets. Landscape and portrait are further split with `and (orientation: landscape/portrait)`. As of 2026-05-14, mobile/touch font sizes in those blocks are smaller than desktop (thead th ~7–7.5px), causing "too small" complaints on tablet and mobile printouts. Active fix branch: `mobile-and-tablet-print`.

**Mobile CSS architecture** — Three CSS files interact on mobile: `styles/mobile.css` (primary mobile rules), `styles/inline-patches.css` (loads after mobile.css, has two `@media (max-width:760px)` blocks — "V2" ~line 509 and "V3 CORRECTION" ~line 728 — both use `!important` and win on specificity ties). When fixing mobile layout, both V2 and V3 blocks in inline-patches.css must be updated, not just mobile.css.

**Landscape phone breakpoint** — `@media (orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 500px)` is the correct way to target landscape iPhones without catching tablets. All iPhones in landscape are ~330–430px tall; all iPads in landscape are >700px tall. The old `max-width:900px and orientation:landscape` approach missed iPhone 14/15/16 Pro Max (932px wide) and could incorrectly match small tablets (~800px wide). Two blocks in `inline-patches.css` (safe-area padding and toolbar single-row) use this breakpoint.

**Toolbar CSS architecture** — `EditorToolbar` renders `.toolbar > .toolbar-head + .toolbar-btns`. On desktop both are `display:contents` (children become direct flex items of `.toolbar`). On mobile they become explicit flex rows: `.toolbar-head` is `justify-content:space-between` (name left, sync pill right); `.toolbar-btns` is a flex row of the four button groups with `gap:4px` and `padding:4px 8px 6px 8px` (no overflow scroll). `SaveDropdown` and `ShareDropdown` compute their dropdown position via `getBoundingClientRect()` and render at `position:fixed` to escape the mobile panel context. `.toolbar` uses `overflow:visible` on mobile — the `border-top-radius:18px` rounds the toolbar's own background paint without needing to clip children. The panel (`.panel`) also uses `overflow:visible` to let fixed-position dropdowns escape.

**Panel flex ordering** — `styles/base.css` adds `display:flex; flex-direction:column` to `.panel` inside `@media screen`, with explicit `order` values that place `.wx-strip` (order 3) after `.meta` (order 2) and before `.scroll-hint`/`.tbl-wrap` (orders 4–5). This visually repositions the weather strip below the schedule header fields and above the grid without moving it in the DOM. Print uses `display:block` (unaffected by `@media screen`), preserving the weather strip's original print position above the header block.

**Weather strip theming** — dark gradient background and light text colors are the global default (also used by print CSS which sets `background:#fff!important` and `color:#111!important` with `!important`). Screen colors are overridden in a separate `@media screen` block: background `#ebebeb`, text uses design system grey variables (`--g400`, `--g600`, `--g800`), links use `--pink`. This lets print CSS remain unchanged.

**CrewIdentityBlock** — `components/schedule/CrewIdentityBlock.tsx` replaces the three `CrewInput` `.mf` fields (Producer, Director, Camera) that previously lived in `ScheduleHeader`'s `meta-grid`. The block sits between `HeaderIdentityLine` and the remaining 3-column `meta-grid` (Town / Date / Call Time). Tap the label or value to edit inline; Enter/blur confirms and calls `updateMeta()` (sets `dirty:true`); Escape reverts. One field editable at a time. Fields: `meta.prod`, `meta.dir`, `meta.dp`. Separated from `meta-grid` by `1.5px solid var(--g300)` border-bottom and `margin-top:12px` on `.meta-grid`.

**Unified meta label style** — `.mf label` (TOWN / LOCATION, DATE, CALL TIME) and `.crew-label` (PRODUCER, DIRECTOR, CAMERA) are intentionally matched: `font-size:10px`, `font-weight:600`, `letter-spacing:1px`, `color:var(--g400)`, `text-transform:uppercase`. Any future label additions in the meta section should use this same style. The old `.mf label` values (11px, .08–.09em letter-spacing, `#71717a`) are superseded.

**Templates** — migrated from localStorage to Netlify Blobs (`schedule-templates` store). One-time migration: on first load, if remote is empty and localStorage has templates, they are pushed up and localStorage is cleared. Templates are accessible from within the editor via the Tools Panel (no longer require closing the schedule to reach the Library).

**Tools Panel** — `ToolsPanel.tsx` mounts via `ReactDOM.createPortal(…, document.body)` to escape all ancestor `overflow` contexts. Renders a backdrop + slide-over panel (380px from right on desktop/tablet; 70vh bottom sheet on mobile). Three tabs: (1) Templates — loads from Netlify Blobs, applies rows in-place via `loadSchedule(scheduleName, …) + updateMeta({})` to preserve the current schedule name while marking dirty; (2) Backup — Export JSON with dated filename; (3) Restore — lists snapshots for the current schedule (no picker), restores via `postSave(force) → loadSchedule → setRemoteBaseline → setSyncStatus('synced')`, with 4-second inline success toast. Snapshot preview overlay uses inline `z-index:10002` to clear the panel's stacking context. Panel z-index: backdrop 10000, panel 10001. Active state `.tp-open` on the Tools toolbar button.

**NOTES column header alignment** — The notes cell (`NotesCell.tsx`) has a `notes-status-wrap` flex row: `status-icon-slot` (24px desktop / 22px mobile ≤760px) + 8px gap + notes textarea. The `<th className="th-notes">` uses `padding-left:37px` (desktop: 5px td-pad + 24px icon + 8px gap) or `36px` (mobile: 6px td-pad + 22px icon + 8px gap) so the header text aligns with the textarea content. Applied to both the actual thead and the `#mobile-grid-sticky` sticky overlay.

**Stacked sub-locations (Phase 4)** — Each `ScheduleRow` has an optional `subLocations?: SubLocation[]` field. Each `SubLocation` carries `{ id, loc, locLat, locLng, done, desc }`. Sub-locations render inline inside the Location cell, stacked below the main location — no modal is used. `LocationCell.tsx` wraps the main location in a `.loc-main-row` container (`position: relative`) so the main map-pin button anchors to that row only, not the full cell including sub-location rows below. Each sub-location has its own `PlacesAutocomplete` instance (same `places.js` proxy) for Google-assisted address entry. The `DescTextarea` helper (private to `LocationCell.tsx`) auto-resizes via `useRef` + `useLayoutEffect` on value change — `useLayoutEffect` is used (not `useEffect`) so the DOM resize happens synchronously before paint and cannot interfere with the `@hello-pangea/dnd` drop animation window. All buttons in `LocationCell.tsx` carry `type="button"` to prevent implicit form submission; the `.loc-add-subloc` button has no CSS `transition` for the same reason. Sub-location edits write directly to the store via `updateRow` on every change — no buffering. The existing row-level contact button (`.done-tools` column) is separate and unrelated to sub-locations; contact-within-sub-location integration is deferred to Phase 4B. Old schedules without `subLocations` work unchanged — the field is absent from `makeRow()` defaults and preserved via `...overrides` spread in `normalizeRow()`. Sub-location data is row-level, not Library data; Library, rename, Move To, archive, delete, Save As, and DnD are unaffected. In print: sub-location `loc` text and `desc` text render; pin, remove, and add controls are hidden (`display: none !important`); `loc-subloc-desc` textareas get `height: auto !important; overflow: visible !important` so full description text is visible.

**Zero-duration rows ("00:00")** — `"00:00"` is a valid duration meaning zero elapsed time, not a missing or blank duration. All "is this duration empty?" guards use `r.dur === ''` (explicit blank-string check), never `!r.dur` or `durMins <= 0` (both falsy for numeric zero). Key behaviors: `computeTimeOut` returns `row.dur === ''` as the blank guard — a row with Time In 9:30 AM and duration "00:00" displays Time Out 9:30 AM (`m12(timeInMins + 0)`). `recalcRows` sets `cursor = timeInMins` when `durMins = 0`, so the next row cascades from the same time. `hasOpenRows` (DnD guard in `ScheduleGrid.tsx`) and `guardReorder` (▲/▼ guard in `RowControls.tsx`) use `r.dur === ''` — "00:00" rows do not block reordering. `nextFixedAnchorMin` and `isLocked` in `lib/time.ts` also use `=== ''` so "00:00" rows neither stop the fixed-anchor search nor lock downstream rows.

**Contact Sheet (Phase 5)** — `ContactSheetModal.tsx` is opened from `ShareDropdown` (Share → "📋 Contact Sheet"). It reads `rows` from `useScheduleStore` and calls `extractContacts()`, which iterates non-sun rows, skips rows with all four contact fields blank, and deduplicates by a `contactName.trim() + '\0' + contactPhone.trim()` key. Rows sharing the same key accumulate row-context entries (`timeIn`, `action`, `loc`, `desc`) under one `ContactEntry`. The modal renders contact cards with name, title, phone, email, and associated row-context lines. An empty state is shown when no contacts exist. CSV download writes 8-column headers (Name, Title, Phone, Email, Time In, Action, Location, Description), one line per contact × row-context pair. **Print approach:** `print.css` hides `.overlay` and `.modal` unconditionally; overriding with higher-specificity selectors is unreliable across print engines. Instead, a second `createPortal` renders `<div className="cs-print-only">` directly on `document.body` — outside the overlay/modal tree — alongside the interactive modal. `handlePrint()` adds `body.cs-printing` before `window.print()` and removes it in the `afterprint` event handler. `@media print` with `body.cs-printing` selector shows `.cs-print-only` and hides the schedule grid, toolbar, and header. The modal and overlay remain hidden per `print.css` as normal. Normal schedule Print/PDF is entirely unaffected. **Current limitations:** one contact per row (no contacts array); no contacts database; contacts not shown in public/client view (`ScheduleReadView` unchanged); no sub-location contacts. `DoneContactCell` and `ContactModal` entry point are unchanged.

**Done/Contact cell column width** — The `.c-cb` column contains both a done checkbox and a 24px contact button in a `display:flex; gap:8px` row (`.done-tools`). On mobile the V9 block (`@media (max-width:760px)` in inline-patches.css) sets the column to 64px with `overflow:hidden` on the td. Width formula: 5px-pad + 20px-checkbox + 8px-gap + 24px-button + 7px-pad ≈ 64px. A narrower column clips the contact button on the right.

**Library auto-grouping tree** — `LibraryTree.tsx` derives the production → phase → schedule hierarchy entirely client-side from schedule metadata (`projectName.trim().toLowerCase()` → prodKey, `phase.trim().toLowerCase()` → phaseKey). No server-side folder data required. `buildTree()` returns `{ productions, ungrouped }`. `ScheduleListTab` is a thin wrapper that just renders `LibraryTree`. Empty productions/phases created via inline "+ Add" inputs are held in component state only (not persisted); they become real once a schedule populates them.

**Library phaseOrder** — Manual drag-and-drop order within a phase is stored in `libMeta.phaseOrder[prodKey][phaseKey]` as an array of schedule names. `applyPhaseOrder()` sorts a phase's schedules by this array; names absent from the array fall back to dayNumber/savedAt sort and append to the end. `onDragEnd` uses `@hello-pangea/dnd`; only same-section (same droppable) reorders are supported — cross-phase and cross-production drops are explicitly rejected with a visible error message. Cross-section drag-and-drop remains intentionally blocked; cross-production/cross-phase movement is instead handled by the explicit Move To workflow (see Library Move To below). After permanent delete, `delete-schedule.js` removes the schedule from all phaseOrder arrays server-side.

**Library Move To** — Moving a schedule between productions or phases is done through an explicit Move To modal, not by drag-and-drop. The Move To button appears in each active schedule row (desktop-only, hidden on mobile alongside the Rename button) and opens a modal with controlled select-style dropdowns for Production and Phase. All existing productions and phases are immediately visible as selectable options; "— Ungrouped —" and "— No phase —" are always available. Choosing "+ New production…" or "+ New phase…" reveals a text input for a custom name. The Phase dropdown uses `<optgroup>` to show phases already used in the selected production first ("This production"), then all other known phases. The modal pre-selects the schedule's current production and phase; the Move button is disabled until the destination actually differs.

The backend operation (`netlify/functions/move-schedule.js`) performs two writes in sequence — this is a **coordinated operation, not a true atomic transaction**:
1. The schedule blob is updated: `meta.projectName` and `meta.phase` are set to the new values; a fresh `savedAt` is written. Schedule data, snapshots, Team Links, and Client Links are all preserved — the schedule name (blob key) does not change.
2. Library metadata is updated: the schedule name is removed from `phaseOrder[oldProdKey][oldPhaseKey]` and appended to the bottom of `phaseOrder[newProdKey][newPhaseKey]`.

If the Library metadata write fails after the blob write succeeds, the schedule blob is the authoritative source for `buildTree()` grouping — the schedule appears in the correct production/phase group on the next Refresh. The phaseOrder position may temporarily float to the bottom of the destination phase until the Library metadata write succeeds; this is the accepted degraded state.

`LibraryPage` applies an optimistic local update immediately on a successful response (patches `schedules` state and `libMeta.phaseOrder`) so no manual Refresh is needed. CDN consistency guard: `SS_MOVES_KEY` (60 s TTL in sessionStorage) is written after a confirmed move; `fetchLibraryData` uses it to patch stale CDN reads — adjusting `phaseOrder` if the schedule still appears in the old location and patching `meta.projectName`/`meta.phase` on fetched blobs that reflect pre-move metadata.

**Library display name overrides** — Renaming a production or phase writes `libMeta.productionDisplayNames[prodKey]` or `libMeta.phaseDisplayNames[prodKey][phaseKey]`. The normalized lowercase key (used for grouping) never changes; only the displayed label changes. Schedule blobs are not touched. The tree applies overrides after `buildTree()`, before merging empty containers.

**Library archive and permanent delete** — `libMeta.tsarchived` is a string array of archived schedule names. Archiving removes the name from active `phaseOrder` entries and from the recent-schedules list. Restoring removes it from `tsarchived`. Permanent delete is only available for archived schedules (active schedules must be archived first). `delete-schedule.js` handles deletion atomically: deletes the schedule blob from the `schedules` store, deletes the associated snapshot blob from `schedule-snapshots` (keyed by `sha256(name)`; best-effort, non-fatal if absent), then reads and rewrites the library metadata blob with the schedule removed from `tsarchived`, `phaseOrder`, `scheduleFolderMap`, `townCache`, and `dateCache`. The two-step confirmation UI (passcode + type "DELETE") lives in `LibraryPage.tsx`. The server validates the delete password independently of the editor token.

**Library rename — key-migration approach** — Renaming a schedule from the Library copies the schedule blob to the new blob key, migrates the snapshot blob (keyed by `sha256(name)`), updates all Library metadata references (phaseOrder, tsarchived, scheduleFolderMap, townCache, dateCache), then deletes the old blobs best-effort. This is the backend flow in `netlify/functions/rename-schedule.js`. The schedule name is both the blob key and the URL segment (`/schedule/[name]`, `/view/[name]`), so rename is not a free metadata-only change — it is a full key migration. Existing Team Links and Client Links using the old name break after rename; users must copy new links. In-editor rename is not implemented; rename is Library-only. A future `scheduleId` architecture (permanent opaque ID separate from the display title) would eliminate the key-migration requirement entirely, but that is not current work.

**Library rename — CDN consistency and client guards** — Netlify Blobs CDN reads use eventual consistency (no `uncachedEdgeURL` configured in this environment; `{ consistency: 'strong' }` is therefore not available). After a rename, the CDN may still serve the old blob key for minutes. Two guards protect against this: (1) a 15-second React-state sync guard (`syncingRenames`) disables opening or re-renaming the schedule immediately after a rename completes; (2) a sessionStorage pending rename map (`SS_RENAMES_KEY`, 60 s TTL) prevents stale blob-list reads from reverting the rename during Library Refresh — if the CDN still shows the old key, `applyPendingRenames` remaps it to the new name or filters it out. Rename-back (A→B→A) has an additional guard: `SS_RENAME_PREV_KEY` (5-min TTL) records each rename's predecessor; `isRenameBackAllowed()` exempts the predecessor from the client-side duplicate check. On the backend, when the `isRenameBack` flag is set and `store.get(newName)` returns a result (stale CDN blob), the backend reads Library metadata as a second authority: if Library no longer references the target name, the blob is a CDN artifact and the rename proceeds; if Library also references the name (genuine conflict or stale Library), a soft "still finalizing" 409 is returned instead of a hard "already exists" error.

**Netlify Blobs eventual consistency and client-side mutation guards** — Netlify Blobs CDN reads can return pre-write state for up to ~15 seconds after a write. `LibraryPage` guards against stale reads silently rolling back confirmed actions using sessionStorage-based pending mutation maps (60-second TTL): `rp_lib_pending_mutations` (archive/restore), `rp_lib_pending_phase_order` (DnD reorder), `rp_lib_pending_deletions` (permanent delete). On each Library fetch, `applyPendingMutations()` overlays pending state onto cloud state; if the cloud has caught up (confirms the mutation), the pending entry is cleared automatically. Guards are stored in sessionStorage rather than `useRef` so they survive in-session navigation (component unmount resets refs). Library metadata saves that fail now revert local state and surface an error banner rather than silently accepting the failure.

**ComboInput** — `components/schedule/ComboInput.tsx` is a controlled input with a filtered suggestion dropdown. `onMouseDown + e.preventDefault()` on options prevents blur-before-click. Pressing Enter fires `onBlur?.()` (commit) whether or not a dropdown item is active; pressing Escape fires `onEscape?.()` (revert). `HeaderIdentityLine` uses a `draftRef` alongside `draft` state so `commit()` always reads the latest value synchronously, even when a dropdown option was just selected (React batching would otherwise lag state).

**Library options cache** — After `LibraryPage` parallel-fetches all schedule data, it writes unique projectName/phase values to `localStorage('rp_lib_project_options')` and `localStorage('rp_lib_phase_options')`. `HeaderIdentityLine` reads these on mount to seed ComboInput suggestions — no extra network calls in the editor.

**Contextual new schedule** — The "+ New Schedule" button inside a named phase navigates to `/schedule/Untitled?proj=X&ph=Y`. `app/(app)/schedule/[name]/page.tsx` reads those search params and passes them as `initMeta` to `ScheduleEditor`. `ScheduleEditor` applies them once (guarded by `initMetaApplied` ref) after `scheduleName === name` resolves, and only if the schedule has no existing projectName/phase (i.e., it's a fresh blank schedule).

## 10. Feature Map

**Schedule editing**: action rows, custom rows, sun rows, notes, call time, location (main location + optional stacked sub-locations: Google Places autocomplete, map pin, status checkbox, description), town, date, weather strip
**Schedule header**: identity line (project/route/day), compact crew block (PRODUCER/DIRECTOR/CAMERA inline edit), Town/Location, Date, Call Time
**Time cascade**: automatic timeOut recalc on any duration/order change
**Drag & drop**: row reorder (row 0 protected), DnD via @hello-pangea/dnd
**Undo/redo**: 80-level history, row-level snapshots
**Conflict detection**: optimistic concurrency via savedAt + content hash, resolution modal (overwrite or reload)
**Auto-snapshot**: every 5 min while dirty
**Manual snapshots**: named versions, restore, compare (BackupTab)
**Library**: collapsible production → phase → schedule tree (auto-grouped from metadata); same-section drag-and-drop reorder within a phase (cross-section DnD intentionally blocked); **Move To** — explicit modal workflow for moving a schedule between productions/phases without cross-section DnD, using controlled select dropdowns with custom/new entry support, preserving schedule name/data/snapshots/links; inline create production/phase; edit display names; contextual + New Schedule pre-populates identity; Links dropdown (Team Link + Client Link); archive/restore; permanent delete for archived schedules only (two-step confirmation, passcode-protected server-side); stale-read protection for recent Library mutations (sessionStorage pending-mutation guards); **rename** — Library-only key-migration rename with duplicate protection, rename-back support, and post-rename CDN sync guard
**Sharing**: Team Link (`?auth=true` deep link), Client Link (`/view/[name]` public)
**Public viewer**: branded read-only view, no auth required
**CMS**: per-brand colors, fonts, logo, action style overrides — applied via CSS custom properties
**Backup**: export current schedule JSON, export all schedules ZIP
**Google Places**: location autocomplete via proxied `places.js` function; shared by main location and sub-location address search
**Weather**: Open-Meteo integration; weather strip sits between Call Time field and schedule grid (screen); light grey background (#ebebeb) with design-system text colors
**Templates**: reusable row sets stored in Netlify Blobs, synced across devices; accessible from within the editor via Tools Panel
**Tools Panel**: slide-over drawer (Templates / Backup / Restore) accessible from the editor toolbar without closing the schedule
**Contact Sheet**: Share → Contact Sheet opens `ContactSheetModal`; extracts contacts from row-level `contactName`/`contactTitle`/`contactPhone`/`contactEmail` fields; deduplicates by name+phone; CSV download; print via `cs-print-only` body portal (editor-only; not in public view)
**Print/PDF**: landscape default via `@page`; filename `"[name] – [YYYY-MM-DD]"` set on `document.title` before print
**PWA**: installable via Safari Add to Home Screen; manifest at `/manifest.webmanifest`

*Last updated: 2026-05-25 — Phase 5 Contact Sheet / Contact Extract complete and tested: `ContactSheetModal` with deduplication, row context, CSV export, and `cs-print-only` body-portal print approach. Normal schedule print unaffected. Contacts remain editor-only; public view and sub-location contacts deferred.*
